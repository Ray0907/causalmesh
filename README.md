# CausalMesh

A distributed causal consistency system implementing vector clocks, CRDTs, and mesh-based peer-to-peer networking.

## Architecture

CausalMesh provides causal consistency guarantees through:

- **Vector Clocks**: Track causality relationships between events across distributed nodes
- **CRDTs**: Conflict-free replicated data types for automatic conflict resolution
- **Mesh Networking**: Peer-to-peer topology with dynamic membership
- **Gossip Protocol**: Efficient state propagation and anti-entropy

## Key Features

- **Causal Consistency**: Preserves causality while allowing concurrent operations
- **Matrix Optimizations**: Upper/lower triangular matrices for memory efficiency
- **Dynamic Optimization**: Automatic upgrade from traditional to optimized clocks based on scale
- **Partition Tolerance**: Continues operating during network partitions
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: CRDT-based merge without coordination

## Core Components

### Vector Clocks (`src/causal_clock.py`)

- Logical time tracking with partial ordering
- Causality detection and event ordering
- O(n) space complexity where n = number of nodes

### CRDT Store (`src/crdt_store.py`)

- **LWWRegister**: Last-Writer-Wins for key-value pairs
- **GSet**: Grow-only sets
- **ORSet**: Observed-Remove sets with add/remove operations

### Mesh Node (`src/mesh_node.py`)

- P2P networking with failure detection
- Dynamic optimization switching
- Causal event processing and consistency checking

### Optimized Vector Clocks (`src/optimized_vector_clock.py`)

- **CompressedVectorClock**: Sparse storage optimization
- **TriangularMatrixClock**: 50% memory savings with matrix storage
- **HybridOptimizedClock**: Combines multiple optimization strategies

## Matrix Optimizations

### 1. Sparse Matrix Optimization

- **Compressed Vector Clock**: Store only non-zero values, save 60-90% memory
- **Use Case**: Large-scale systems where only subset of nodes are active

### 2. Triangular Matrix Optimization

- **Upper Triangular Storage**: Leverage symmetry properties, save ~50% space
- **Use Case**: Systems with hierarchical node structures

### 3. Incremental Compression

- **Delta Storage**: Transmit only changes, reduce network overhead
- **Use Case**: Frequent network synchronization in distributed environments

### 4. Hybrid Optimization Strategy

- **Adaptive Selection**: Automatically choose optimal strategy based on usage patterns
- **Dynamic Compression**: Auto-trigger compression when threshold reached

## Usage

```python
from src.mesh_node import MeshNode

# Create a node with optimization
node = MeshNode("node_1", "localhost", 8000, use_optimized_clock=True)

# Start the node
await node.start()

# Perform causal operations
await node.causal_put("key1", "value1")
result = await node.causal_get("key1")

# Check optimization metrics
metrics = node.get_optimization_metrics()
print(f"Memory savings: {metrics['memory_savings']['savings_percent']:.1f}%")
```

## Use Cases

CausalMesh is ideal for:

- **Collaborative Applications**: Document editing, shared workspaces
- **Distributed Databases**: Multi-master replication scenarios
- **Edge Computing**: Partition-tolerant distributed state
- **Research**: Distributed systems algorithm implementation

## Comparison with Redis

CausalMesh trades raw performance for consistency guarantees:

- **Redis**: 100k+ ops/sec, eventual consistency
- **CausalMesh**: 10-50k ops/sec, causal consistency with automatic conflict resolution

Choose CausalMesh when you need strong consistency guarantees in a distributed environment.
